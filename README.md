## 👋 Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

In the fast-paced financial markets, the ability to make informed trading decisions is paramount. OptiTrade empowers traders by offering a comprehensive platform that combines real-time market data with intelligent portfolio optimization techniques. This innovative approach enables users to navigate market complexities and enhance their trading strategies effectively.

## 🚀 Features <a name="features"></a>
- **Real-Time Market Data**: Access live updates for NASDAQ-listed stocks, ensuring you stay informed of market fluctuations.
- **Advanced Charting Tools**: Utilize various technical analysis tools, including moving averages, MACD, and candlestick charts, for informed trading decisions.
- **Order Management**: Execute a variety of order types efficiently (market orders, limit orders, stop-loss) with an intuitive interface.
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Implement a modified Deep Q-Network (DQN) from Reinforcement Learning (RL) for dynamic asset allocation based on market trends.
- **Alerts & Notifications**: Set up real-time alerts to notify you of significant market movements and portfolio changes.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with both novice and experienced traders in mind, offering a smooth user experience.

## 📖 Background <a name="background"></a>
In the fast-paced financial landscape, efficient capital allocation is critical. Traditional investment models often rely on static historical data, which may not respond well to market volatility. OptiTrade aims to revolutionize investment management by incorporating machine learning techniques that allow for adaptive strategies in real-time environments.

### Traditional Investment Limitations 
- Static portfolio management strategies that fail to adapt to real-time data.
- Emotional decision-making processes that can cloud judgment during trading.
- Overfitting in traditional models that do not generalize to new market conditions.

## 🎯 Goals and Objectives <a name="goals-and-objectives"></a>
- Develop a stock trading app specifically for NASDAQ stocks.
- Integrate advanced tools for portfolio management and optimization.
- Provide users with actionable insights and alerts to enhance trading strategies.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack <a name="tech-stack"></a>
- **Frontend**: Built using React, Next.js for web applications, and React Native for mobile applications, ensuring a responsive and seamless user experience across devices.
- **Backend**: Server-side logic developed with Node.js and Express.js, alongside PostgreSQL for robust database management.
- **API Development**: Utilize Django Rest Framework or FastAPI to create secure and efficient APIs for data interaction.
- **AI Components**: Employ PyTorch for developing machine learning models, including RL and LSTM for predictive analytics and portfolio rebalancing.

## 🧪 Usage <a name="usage"></a>
Once the app is set up, users can:
1. Create an account to access personalized features.
2. Monitor real-time market data and analyze stocks.
3. Execute trades using the order management system.
4. Utilize portfolio optimization tools for better asset allocation.

## 📈 Future Improvements <a name="future-improvements"></a>
- Expand to support additional stock exchanges beyond NASDAQ.
- Implement advanced machine learning models for improved accuracy in predictions.
- Enhance user interface and experience based on user feedback and testing.

## ⚠️ Limitations <a name="limitations"></a>
- **Regulatory Approval**: Implementing real trading functionalities requires approval from financial regulatory bodies, which can be a lengthy process.
- **Brokerage and Transaction Costs**: Establishing a live trading environment incurs substantial costs, which are outside the scope of this project.
- **Paper Trading**: Currently, the app employs simulated trading for practice without financial risk, which does not capture the emotional dynamics of live trading.
- **Synthetic Order Books**: Transactions performed in the app will be virtual, and while they mimic real-world scenarios, they may not fully reflect market complexities.
