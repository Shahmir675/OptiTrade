## 👋 Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

In today’s rapidly evolving financial landscape, traders are constantly seeking ways to enhance their decision-making processes. OptiTrade is designed as a cutting-edge stock trading application that leverages advanced technologies like Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning to optimize trading strategies.

This platform empowers users—be it novice or experienced traders—by providing access to real-time market data, which is crucial for making informed decisions in a fast-paced environment. With the financial markets influenced by numerous factors, including economic indicators and market sentiment, traditional trading methods often fall short in adaptability.

OptiTrade addresses these challenges by incorporating machine learning algorithms that analyze vast amounts of market data. This allows the app to adapt to dynamic market conditions and provide users with timely insights and alerts that can improve their trading strategies.

The application offers advanced features like customizable charting tools, order management systems, and portfolio optimization techniques. By employing a modified Deep Q-Network (DQN), OptiTrade helps users manage their investments more effectively, allowing for strategic asset allocation based on real-time market trends.

## 🚀 Features <a name="features"></a>

The key features of OptiTrade include the following:

- **Real-Time Market Data**: Access live updates for NASDAQ-listed stocks, ensuring users stay informed of market fluctuations.
- **Advanced Charting Tools**: Utilize various technical analysis tools, including moving averages, MACD, and candlestick charts, for informed trading decisions.
- **Order Management**: Execute a variety of order types efficiently (market orders, limit orders, stop-loss) with an intuitive interface.
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Implement a modified Deep Q-Network (DQN) from Reinforcement Learning (RL) for dynamic asset allocation based on market trends.
- **Alerts & Notifications**: Set up real-time alerts to notify users of significant market movements and portfolio changes.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with both novice and experienced traders in mind, offering a smooth user experience.

## 📖 Background <a name="background"></a>

In the fast-paced financial landscape, efficient capital allocation is critical. Traditional investment models often rely on static historical data, which may not respond well to market volatility. OptiTrade aims to revolutionize investment management by incorporating machine learning techniques that allow for adaptive strategies in real-time environments.

### Traditional Investment Limitations

Investors and current traditional apps suffer from the following problems:

- Static portfolio management strategies that fail to adapt to real-time data.
- Emotional decision-making processes by investors that can cloud judgment during trading.
- Overfitting in traditional models that do not generalize to new market conditions.

## 🎯 Goals and Objectives <a name="goals-and-objectives"></a>

The goals and objectives of OptiTrade are listed below:

- Develop a stock trading app specifically for NASDAQ stocks.
- Integrate advanced tools for portfolio management and optimization.
- Provide users with actionable insights and alerts to enhance trading strategies.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack <a name="tech-stack"></a>  

The tech stack for OptiTrade consists of the following tools:

- **Frontend**: Built using React, Next.js for web applications, and React Native for mobile applications, ensuring a responsive and seamless user experience across devices.
- **Backend**: Server-side logic developed with Node.js and Express.js, alongside PostgreSQL for robust database management.
- **API Development**: Utilize Django Rest Framework or FastAPI to create secure and efficient APIs for data interaction.
- **AI Components**: Employ PyTorch for developing machine learning models, including RL and LSTM for predictive analytics and portfolio rebalancing.

## 🧪 Usage <a name="usage"></a>
Once the app is set up, users can:
1. Create an account to access personalized features.
2. Set up their own risk profile.
3. Monitor real-time market data and analyze stocks.
4. Execute trades using the order management system.
5. Utilize portfolio optimization tools for better asset allocation.

## ⚠️ Limitations <a name="limitations"></a>

Just like any software system, OptiTrade also has some limitations, related to regulatory approvals, brokerage costs and transaction mechanism. These are detailed below:

- **Regulatory Approval**: Implementing real trading functionalities requires approval from financial regulatory bodies, which can be a lengthy and costly process.
- **Brokerage and Transaction Costs**: Establishing a live trading environment incurs substantial costs, which are outside the scope of this project.
- **Paper Trading**: Due to the issues with regulatory approval and costs, the app employs simulated trading for practice without financial risk, which does not capture the emotional dynamics of live trading.
- **Synthetic Order Books**: Since the paper trading transactions cannot execute actual orders in the market, transactions performed in the app will be virtual, and while they mimic real-world scenarios, they may not fully reflect market complexities.

## 📈 Future Improvements <a name="future-improvements"></a>

The following enhancements are planned for the future of our platform:

- Expand to support additional stock exchanges beyond NASDAQ.
- Evolve from paper trading to executing actual transactions with a brokerage.
- Implement advanced machine learning models for improved accuracy in predictions.
- Enhance user interface and experience based on user feedback and testing.
